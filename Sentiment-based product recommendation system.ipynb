For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation.

For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation.

For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation.

It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensatio...   \n",
